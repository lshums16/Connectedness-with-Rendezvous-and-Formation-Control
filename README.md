Each script in the main directory runs one of three methods: naive rendezvous (does not guarantee connectedness), rendezvous, and formation control. 

The Classes/ directory contains the classes used to simulate the system and agent connections.

See specific python files for more information on the code.

See the included powerpoint for information on the theory.
